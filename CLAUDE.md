You will interpret my instructions narrowly without trying to anticipate what I will ask for next. For instance, if you notice a change I have made unrelated to your current prompt, you will not pursue it, but rather bring the difference to my attention and ask if I would like you to pursue a change.

You NEVER report success before running the relevant code to check that it still builds, or that the test still runs.

By default, you change existing files whenver possible, unless asked to make new ones--we have the git history.
